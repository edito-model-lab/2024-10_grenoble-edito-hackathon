#  🚀 **Compute Wavenumber Spectra from SWOT L3 Data**

## 📝 **Short Description:**
Use of Widetrax package to compute the wavenumber spectra from SWOT L3 SSH data. 

## 🌟 **Expected Benefit of the Project:**
Provide an open-source pipeline and streamline the processing and calculation of wavenumber spectra from SWOT data, ensuring they are robust and accessible for the scientific community.

## 📊 **Datasets:**
SWOT L3 data (not currently stored on EDITO). The data can be accessed directly from AVISO or uploaded to EDITO personal storage space.

## 💻 **Codebase:**
Widetrax package (https://github.com/meom-group/widetrax.)

## ☁️ **Compute Resources:**
Storage: Approximately 5 to 7 GB of storage for the SWOT L3 data. A few CPUs
